    "text": "Create the repo\nWhen we first log in to GitHub, our homepage will look something like this. To create a repo, click the green New button in the left hand Top Repositories section.\n\nWe will also find this button in the Repositories sections on our profile and within any organisations that we are part of. They all lead to the same place. Which is here:\n\nUnpopulatedPopulated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are several things that need filling, and some that don’t. We take them from the top:\n\nRepository template- A couple of teams have set up templates for their repos to make life easier for them e.g. if they create a lot of repos with the same structures. If you haven’t created a template or don’t recognise any of them, you probably want to leave this as No template.\nOwner- Depending on where you were when you clicked the New Repository button, this will default to either your own account or one of your organisations. It’s up to you where you store your repos but, generally, you would want to put work that you intend to share with colleagues within the organisation and keep only personal things in your own area.\nRepository name- This should be a unique name that is short but reasonably descriptive. GitHub will handily tell you if the name is already in use somewhere else. Repo names shouldn’t include spaces but don’t worry if you forget, GitHub will replace spaces with hyphens.\nDescription- Although this field is optional, it’s a good idea to put something in here to help you (and others) quickly identify what the code is.\nPublic / Private- If you select Public then anyone anywhere can see your repo and the code within it. Selecting Private means that only those within the organisation (if the owner is an organisation) can see the code. Generally, this should be the default option- you can always change the privacy later.\nAdd a README file- Again, this is optional but generally a good idea. It will automatically create a markdown file with the repo name as the title and the description as the contents. You can then add details about the project including inputs, outputs, purpose, methodology etc. which will help you and others trying to use your code later.\nAdd .gitignore- A gitignore file tells GitHub which files to not look at and not publish. This could be things like data or personal user keys that you don’t want to share. We will use these more when we look at using GitHub Desktop but it is less important if you just plan to upload files manually.\nChoose a license- This just tells people what they can do with their code. You can leave this as None if you want or, if you’re happy for people to use and replicate your code as they please, you might choose the MIT License.\n\nNow you can click Create repository."

    "text": "Local repo management\n\nCreate a repo\nEven though it looks a little different, a lot of the process to create a repo in GitHub Desktop is similar to that of creating a repo in the browser, see Section 3.1 for a reminder. The main difference is that your repo will live locally until you choose to publish to GitHub, so no need to choose where it lives or privacy settings. You will, however need to choose which local file to put the repo folder- this will be where you save all your code.\n\n\n\n.gitignore\n\nWhat is it for?\nSetting up a gitignore file is a bit more important when working from GitHub desktop than when simply uploading files to the browser version. By default, all the files in the repo folder will be included in the repo. However, there are likely to be some files or information that you don’t want to share. For example, this could be data or sensitive connection strings. The gitignore file tells the repo which files not to look at.\n\n\nHow do we set one up?\nThis file can be set up when you create the repo by selecting a specific gitignore template. This will ignore a determined list of filetypes which are commonly associated with the option you select. For example, if you select the R gitignore template, the file will include all R History, R Data, R User Data, etc. It can be a good starting point if you don’t know where to start.\n\n\nHow can I add new files to the gitignore?\nFiles can be added to the gitignore manually by right clicking on a file in the Changes section of GitHub desktop, and clicking Ignore file. You can choose whether to add the individual file or all files of the same filetype (this might be useful if you want to blanket ignore e.g. .csv files)\n\n\nHow can I make manual changes?\nYou can change your gitignore file as you go along by opening it as a text file, making your changes, and saving them. You can then commit changes to your gitignore file in the same way as you commit changes to any other file in the repo so that they are tracked.\nAlternatively, you can update the gitignore by navigating to Repository > Repository settings > Ignored files and make changes there.\n\n\nWhat can go in the gitignore?\n\nIndividual files: you can ignore individual files by typing the filename\nWhole filetypes: if you want to ignore all of a particular filetype just prefix the filetype with an asterisk e.g. *.xlsx\nFolders and subfolders: if you don’t want a whole folder included, you can just name the folder path e.g. /data\n\n\n\n\nLocal changes\nUntil you click Publish repository, everything you create will live locally. This means that you can make changes to your files and code and play about endlessly until you’re happy to share more widely. It’s still a good idea to manage and commit changes.\nYou should now be able to create your projects and files within the repo folder (which lives wherever you decided when you set up the repo). You are then free to code / change files as you would normally within whichever programmes you use. All your saved changes will be tracked.\nAny changes you save in any files in this folder (that aren’t ignored) will appear in the GitHub desktop changes section. You can see which file has changed, what has been removed (red), and what has been added (green). If you like the changes, ensure that the tick box is checked on the left of the file name, name your commit and add a description (optional), and click Commit to main.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA green square on the right of the file indicates a completely new file, orange indicates changes to an existing file, red indicates a deleted file.\n\n\n\nYou can make changes to multiple files in a single commit or commit them separately if you are likely to want to revisit multiple changes separately\n\n\nHistory\nIf you need to review or revisit any prior commits, you can see these in the History tab."
